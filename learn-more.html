      <p>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make

        I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Stop talking, brain
        thinking. Hush. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>
