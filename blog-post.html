      <p>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make
        you feel better? It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! They're not aliens,
        they're Earth…liens! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? The way I see it, every life is a
        pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the
        bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. It's art! A statement on modern
        society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No,
        I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I'm nobody's taxi service;
        I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Stop talking, brain
        thinking. Hush. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>
