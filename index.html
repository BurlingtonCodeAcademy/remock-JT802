            <p>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to
                make you feel better? It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! They're
                not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? The way I see it,
                every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad
                things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
                It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at
                fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. Aw, you're all Mr.
                Grumpy Face today. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel
                like jumping out of a spaceship. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Sorry, checking all the water in
                this area; there's an escaped fish.
